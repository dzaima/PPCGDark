A collection of my dark themes for PPCG.

Main theme - based on [Stack Overflow Dark](https://github.com/StylishThemes/StackOverflow-Dark): [install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dzaima/PPCGDark/master/PPCGDark.user.css)

Chat theme - based on [Stack Chat Dark + Modifications](https://userstyles.org/styles/143002/stack-chat-dark-modifications): [install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dzaima/PPCGDark/master/darkChat.user.css)

Tiny addon - clicking on the SE logo brings you to the main mage (as the site banner is removed): [install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dzaima/PPCGDark/master/quickMain.user.js)

And of course, obligatory dark scrollbars: [install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dzaima/PPCGDark/master/darkScrollbars.user.css) (webkit-specific)

Works in conjunction with [the PPCG design](https://github.com/vihanb/PPCG-Design), should also work together with [ATaco's userscripts](https://github.com/TehFlaminTaco/TacosUserscripts).
